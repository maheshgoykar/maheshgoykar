        <P>display: inline , the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.</P><br>
        <p>display: block means that the element is displayed as a block, as paragraphs and headers have always been. A block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no HTML elements next to it, except when ordered otherwise</p><br>
        <p>display: <q>inline-block</q> Property: This property is used to display an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but it can apply height and width values </p><br>
